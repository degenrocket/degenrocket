The Signer and Protocol Agnostic Social Media (SPASM) network consists of independent self-hosted interoperable instances run by DAOs, local communities, and other freedom seekers who want to escape censorship and surveillance of centralized platforms.

DegenRocket is the first free and open-source off-chain online forum within the Spasm network, which currently allows users to sign messages with Ethereum and Nostr private keys. More private keys are planned to be added in the future.

The future of social media is agnostic to signing keys, messaging protocols, and transport protocols. Users should be able to sign messages with any private key of their choice and trigger the propagation of those messages in any network they want via any transport protocol, or even all at once.

The Spasm network is the next step in the evolution of social media after various signature-based decentralized ecosystems like Secure Scuttlebutt, Steem/Hive, Nostr, Farcaster, Lens, etc.
