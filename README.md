The Signer and Protocol Agnostic Social Media (SPASM) network consists of independent self-hosted interoperable instances run by DAOs, local communities, and other freedom seekers who want to escape censorship and surveillance of centralized platforms.

DegenRocket is the first free and open-source off-chain online forum within the SPASM network, which currently allows users to sign messages with Ethereum and Nostr private keys. More private keys are planned to be added in the future.
